## Notes

In a matrix, the columns are referred to as:
- variables,
- features, or
- artibutes,
while rows are normally referred to as:
- observations,
- data points,
- records,
- samples, or
- examples.

Types of arrays based on their dimensions:

| Dimensions | Name |
| -------- | ------- |
| 0 | Scale |
| 1 | Vector |
| 2 | Matrix |
| 3 | Tensor |

### OOP 
Object Oriented Programming is structured around two main concepts:
- Object
- Class. A class is a funnel, a blueprint for objects. A real-life example could be "human". Classes can have **methods**, specific functions that change their state. They also have static properties, which are called **atributes**.
  - Methods --> dynamic.
  - Attributes --> static.
  - A class can inherit from another class called superclass or parent class. So the "student" class could inherit from the "human" class.

### 3 types of missing values
- MAR: Missing At Random - Value is missing connected to another value
- MCAR: Missing Completely At Random - Value is missing completely randomly
- MNAR: Missing Not At Random - Value is missing because of a characteristic of the value

### Types of Join
