### Relational Databases

Columns are generally called attributes.

In SQL, each row has to be unique. Primary keys make sure this requirement is met. This primary key is normally an auto-incremental int.

Every value has to be atomic, non-divisible. We can't have something like a list inside a value.

#### Normal Forms
1NF up to 6NF (normal form). \
- 1NF: all primery keys are unique and all values are atomic.
